# Visual Analytics Midterm Project
## This repo is about the Tableau Workbook for Fall '24 Visual Analytics Course

### Introduction
 The dashboard would be utilized by healthcare workers to get a quick overview of the most current observation values from collecting vitals to lab reports while also seeing past trends to compare them to what may be the patient's normal or if values are getting better or worsening. 


### Data: mCODE's synthetic oncology EHR data was used due to it being the standard for realistic yet safe medical record data to use for testing applications such as this visual project here! It specifically was used as well due to the set having 10 years of medical history within them to be able to make proper visualizations that didn't hold only one point. It was made into a csv due to Tableau not parsing the JSON files correctly so Python and the fhiry library was used to extract from the bundle. 


### Future Work: As I gain more understanding of how to use FHIR formatted JSON's I would like to further have the option for a nurse to view multiple paitents but also an aggregate of all the patients they may be seeing at the moment.
